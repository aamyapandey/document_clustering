Semantic Understanding of Large Text Corpora
This project explores intelligent extraction of patterns from large text datasets using advanced topic modeling and clustering algorithms. Designed for both research curiosity and practical utility, it transforms raw textual information into structured semantic insight.

Key Features:
Topic Modeling at Scale
Uses unsupervised algorithms to uncover latent themes across document collections with minimal human input.

Corpus Clustering
Automatically groups semantically similar documents using optimized vector space representations and distance metrics.

Flexible File Ingestion
Supports individual .txt files as well as compressed archives for large-scale analysis.

Live Interactive Interface
Built with Streamlit, offering real-time configuration of models, cluster count, and visualization preferences.

Ready for Customization
Easily extendable for sentiment tagging, keyphrase extraction, or domain-specific tuning.


this project is not a dataset specific. any dataset containt .txt files can be used.
